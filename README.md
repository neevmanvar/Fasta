# Fasta
Program contains How to read Fasta file and How to get all dna sequences and how to use those sequences.

dna2.zip File contains dna2.fasta file.

These fasta file has multiple dna sequences, ID's of dna sequences. I build python program to answer following questions.

How many records are in the file? A record in a FASTA file is defined as a single-line header, followed by lines of sequence data. The header line is distinguished from the sequence data by a greater-than (">") symbol in the first column.

What are the lengths of the sequences in the file? What is the longest sequence and what is the shortest sequence? Is there more than one longest or shortest sequence? What are their identifiers?

what is the length of the longest ORF in the file? What is the identifier of the sequence containing the longest ORF? For a given sequence identifier, what is the longest ORF contained in the sequence represented by that identifier? What is the starting position of the longest ORF in the sequence that contains it?

What is the most frequent dna sequence with length of 'L'?

This is my first project about genomic data science. Hope you like it.
